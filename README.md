# Intro to Machine Learning Workshop

This repo contains supporting materials from the intro to machine learning
workshop at the thoughtbot summer summit 2018.

Before you begin, you need to install **Python 3.6** and **pipenv**.
On macOS, that could look like this:

```
brew install python3
pip3 install pipenv
```

Once you have those, you can install the dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

Finally, you can run the Jupyter Notebook server:

```
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

That will open up a browser, where you can play around with the notebooks.
